Package without running unit tests:

mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true


If you merged a branch to master by accident and it is the last commit (but not yet pushed) revert the commit with :


git reset --hard HEAD~1

Pull a branch from remote (when the branch does not exist in local repository)
git branch -f PingService origin/PingService
